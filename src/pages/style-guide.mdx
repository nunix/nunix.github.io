## 01. TYPOGRAPHY & TEXT

This is a standard paragraph. The font should be readable, optimized for long-form technical reading. It should have sufficient contrast against the background.

* **Bold Text:** Used for emphasis.
* *Italic Text:* Used for subtle emphasis.
* `Inline Code`: Used for variables, paths, or short commands.
* [Hyperlink]: Should light up Neon Blue on hover.

> **Blockquote:** This is a blockquote. It should look distinct from regular text, often used for quotes or side notes.

:::note [ SYSTEM NOTE ]

:::

:::

:::warning [ CAUTION ]

## 03. CODE TERMINALS

Testing the custom scrollbars, "Mac-style" buttons, and copy-paste functionality.

```ts title="/src/components/SystemCore.ts"
// TypeScript Example
import React from 'react';

interface SystemProps {
  status: 'online' | 'offline';
  latency: number;
}

export const checkSystem = (props: SystemProps): boolean => {
  if (props.latency > 500) {
    console.warn('High Latency Detected');
    return false;
  }
  return true;
};
